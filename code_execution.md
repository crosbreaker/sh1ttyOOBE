### How do I use this to get code execution (dev mode recovery root terminal?)
1.  Do [sh1ttyOOBE with persistence](./README.md)
2.  Make a 124 or older [badrecovery](https://github.com/BinBashBanana/badrecovery) unverified image
3.  Recover to it in developer mode
### Why is this useful? 
You can get a rootshell while enrolled, allowing for exploits such as daub and [PencilSharpener](https://github.com/truekas/PencilSharpener)
