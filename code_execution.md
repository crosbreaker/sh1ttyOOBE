### How do I use this to get code execution (dev mode recovery root terminal?)
1.  Do [sh1ttyOOBE](./README.md) and the [persistence method](./README.md#persistence-method)
2.  Make a 124 or older [badrecovery](https://github.com/BinBashBanana/badrecovery) unverified image
3.  Recover to it in developer mode
### Why is this useful? 
You can get a rootshell while enrolled, allowing for exploits such as daub and [PencilSharpener](https://github.com/truekas/PencilSharpener)/[normal pencil](https://blogkn.vercel.app/blog/3-the-tsunami) depending on if your device is ti50 or a cr50 model.  \
Please refer to the below table of common keyrolled devices and their tpm versions.
| Devices   | TPM version   |
|-----------|-------|
| Corsola     | Ti50  |
| Dedede    | Cr50  |
| Nissa   | Ti50  |
